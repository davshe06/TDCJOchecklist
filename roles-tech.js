   Tech & Engineering Job Order Intake — Role Configurations
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Step 1 selects a ROLE. Everything downstream (focus areas, deep-dive
   question sets, team specialists, tech-stack categories, success metrics,
   candidate backgrounds, AI use cases, and the recruiter-targeting profile)
   is driven by the selected role's config below.

   To add a role: add an entry to ROLES and list its id in ROLE_ORDER.
   app.js is a generic engine and needs no changes.

   Question types: text, textarea, number, select, radio, chips (multi-select)
   Conditional questions use showIf(answers, state).
   Tips use when(answers, state); areaPriority(state, id) reads the active
   role's focus-area priority ("must" | "nice" | "skip").
